## Get HTML website
This little project is to demonstrate how to scrape a website using BeautifulSoup module in python. I pull data from the ycombinator website (https://news.ycombinator.com/news) and parse through the html.

We parse through the list of articles on the ycombinator home page and find the one with the most upvotes and print it.
